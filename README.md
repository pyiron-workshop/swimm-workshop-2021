# Simulation Workflows in Materials Modelling (SWiMM 2021)
March 15, 2021 - March 26, 2021 (Postponed from 2020 program)

As part of the workshop for [Simulation Workflows in Materials Modelling](https://www.cecam.org/workshop-details/27) we present a series of pyiron tutorials, starting from a basic introduction to pyiron, followed by a focus session on up-scaling existing workflows and finally the implementation of new simulation codes and general open science activities of the pyiron project.
